‚ú® Project Overview
Drake UNIX is an innovative UNIX-based decentralized application (DApp) that leverages modern programming paradigms to enhance user experience and operational efficiency. The goal is to build a flexible platform that integrates various services and applications within a UNIX environment, providing users with a seamless and robust toolset for digital asset management.

ü§ñ The Power of UNIX
UNIX operating systems are known for their stability, security, and powerful command-line interface. By developing Drake UNIX, we aim to utilize the inherent strengths of UNIX to create a platform that supports complex processes, efficient resource management, and high-performance applications. The combination of containerization, scripting, and efficient data management ensures that Drake UNIX is both versatile and scalable.

‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
Ensure you have a UNIX-based operating system (Linux or macOS) installed.
Install necessary compilers for C and Python.
Install Go for service development.
Set up PostgreSQL for database management.
Install Docker for application containerization.
Basic understanding of C, Bash, Python, Go, PostgreSQL, Docker, GraphQL, React, Material UI, Rubyx, WFIT, and Swift is required.
